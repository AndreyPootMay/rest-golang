## Rest Golang

This is a basic example of an REST API written in golang.

### Install

1. You may need golang installed in your computer.
2. Clone the repository using the next command `gh repo clone AndreyPootMay/rest-golang`
3. Navigate inside the folder using the command `cd rest-golang`
4. Install the dependency named *CompiledDaemon*; use the command `go get github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon`
5. Execute the code and develop inside of it `~/go/bin/CompileDaemon -command="./rest-golang"`.

You can use Infomnia Rest Client to test the REST API Methods with importing the request collection. The Rest collection name is `Insomnia_2022-05-11.json`.
